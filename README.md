# getman
Getman is a web app that allows you to manage XMLHttpRequest to various servers, and see their response. 
this simple web app allows you to create a request using GET, POST, PUT and DELETE as methods, and sending data as JSONs, FormData Objects or URLencoded data. 

You can manage up to 30 requests using a user-friendly GUI. 
you may change this limit in the source code.

The code variables and functions (and comments) are made in english, however, the GUI is design in spanish (the official language of the
university).

enjoy it!
